AI includes both science and engineering, ie. understanding and also creating intelligent agents

There are 4 main aims of AI:

1. Acting like humans
2. Thinking like humans
3. Acting rationally
4. Thinking rationally

AI does things, and figures out how to do those things, and one of those things is emulating us.

The Turing test is important thought experiment in terms of understanging what we want from AI, but nobody is trying to make and AI that can pass the Turing test.

Part of understaning intelligence is understanding human intelligence. This comes under cognitive science.

An intelligent agent at its simplest is something that responds to its environment, often with simple rules like a roomba.
