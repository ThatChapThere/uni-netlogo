# Introduction

AI includes both science and engineering, ie. understanding and also creating intelligent agents

There are 4 main aims of AI:

1. Acting like humans
2. Thinking like humans
3. Acting rationally
4. Thinking rationally

AI does things, and figures out how to do those things, and one of those things is emulating us.

The Turing test is important thought experiment in terms of understanging what we want from AI, but nobody is trying to make and AI that can pass the Turing test.

Part of understaning intelligence is understanding human intelligence. This comes under cognitive science.

An intelligent agent at its simplest is something that responds to its environment, often with simple rules like a roomba.

One type of agent which we will deal with fairly often in the module is a simple reflex agent. This is an agent that does not store what happened in the past, but simply acts based on what it currently observes.

## Dichotomies

In all cases, the first of the two listed is the one which is easier to implement

1. Fully vs partially observable (aka. accessible vs non-accessible)
2. Deterministic vs non-deterministic (non-deterministic can be called **stochastic**, but only if it follows probability theory)
3. Episodic vs sequential (aka. non-episodic) 
4. Static vs dynamic
5. Discrete vs continuous
